      "The Transformers library is undergoing it's largest pivot to date üôå\n",
      "\n",
      "It now cements its role as the central model definition, irrespective of the backend and runner. One ground truth to bring more reliability across the ecosystem.\n",
      "\n",
      "This comes into play as Transformers becomes a backend of:\n",
      "\n",
      "- most popular inference engines like vLLM, SGLang, TGI, TensorRT, ...\n",
      "- training frameworks like Axolotl, Unsloth, DeepSpeed, FSDP, PyTorch-Lightning, ...\n",

      "Transformers is the pivot across frameworks: if a model is integrated, then you're certain it is handled by the rest of the ecosystem. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a field where ML releases are more and more frequent, keeping track of integrations in all downstream libraries can become a headache.\n",
      "\n",
      "By having Transformers as a backend, you get immediate access to all 300+ supported architectures, and you're ensured immediate access to upcoming model releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "This often means day-0 access, but also community-fixes, and a shared baseline for evaluation.\n",

      "-  Integrations are simpler & faster\n",
      "- Models continue being adaptable, customizable\n",
